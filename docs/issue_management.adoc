== Categorization

Issues are labelled.
There are six broad categories of labels used (colour category in brackets):

. **New or Expanded Functionality (blue shades)**
.. _feature_ – Proposes new capability or functionality.
.. _enhancement_ – Requests an improvement or extension of existing functionality.

. **Code‑Quality & Performance (green shades)**
.. _optimization_ – Suggests performance, memory, or speed improvements without changing behaviour.
.. _refactor_ – Involves restructuring code while preserving external behaviour.
.. _test_ – Adds, fixes, or improves automated tests.
.. _ci_ – Concerns continuous‑integration (CI) configuration, pipelines, or related failures.

. **User‑Facing Experience (amber/orange shades)**
.. _ux_ – Addresses UI layout, accessibility, or workflow improvements.
.. _docs_ – Updates, corrects, or adds documentation.

. **Issue Management & Triage (red shades)**
.. _bug_ – Reports an error, crash, or incorrect behaviour.
.. _duplicate_ – This issue or pull request already exists.
.. _invalid_ – Issue is malformed, off‑topic, or lacks necessary information.
.. _question_ – Seeks clarification, usage guidance, or information rather than reporting a problem.
.. _wontfix_ – Maintainers have decided not to address the issue.

. **Community & Contribution (violet shades)**
.. _good first issue_ – Good for newcomers, relatively easy and well-scoped.
