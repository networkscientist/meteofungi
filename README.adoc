[NOTE]
====
Name change incoming: I discovered the project https://www.meteofunghi.it/[meteofunghi], an Italian web site that seems to predict mushrooms occurences with meteo data. I had not previously known of the project; however, since its purpose is very similar to ours and their name is nearly identical, I decided to change the name of our project. Their work deserves respect and they were the first ones to come up with the name meteofunghi, so it is only fair that we adapt.
Therefore, the MeteoFungi repository will change its name to MeteoShrooms. Not immediately, though, because I currently lack insight what consequences a name change has. I don't want to mess up the project, so you'll have to wait a bit for the new name...
This means that the dashboard is now available at https://meteoshrooms.streamlit.app[https://meteoshrooms.streamlit.app]

With _MeteoFungi_, You can keep track of the perfect conditions for mushroom hunting.
We take Open Government Data (OGD) from the official Swiss Meteorological Service MeteoSwiss to calculate key metrics.

== Motivation

While hunting mushrooms happens in nature, a lot of the planning can be carried out beforehand.
Where are possible areas to find boletes?
Should You leave the house right now or are you already too late?
And will Your current small basket be large enough or is it time to invest in something bigger?
Meteorological data, time series of past findings as well as other datasets can give us valuable insights.

== Concept

== Overarching Vision

The main goal is to develop a model to predict mushrooms occurences using OGD data.
I suggest starting with _meteo_ data by https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/service/open-data.html[MeteoSwiss], _soil_ properties (see for example https://data.geo.admin.ch/browser/index.html[data.geo.admin.ch] or https://opendata.swiss/de[opendata.swiss]) and using open _mushroom observation data_ from https://www.gbif.org/[GBIF].

=== Spatial

Currently, the _MeteoFungi_ project is focussed on Switzerland, as https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch[MeteoSwiss] has started to provide access to their data as https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/services-and-publications/service/open-data.html[OGD].

=== Technical

A main aim is to have sound results calculated efficiently.
Therefore, Python _Polars_ is used for calculations, wherever possible.
Its _LazyFrames_ optimize the workflow.
Data quality is validated through _Pandera_.
Compressed _Parquet_-Files save storage space and up-/download bandwith.

Currently, the repository hosts all parts of the modelling process: 1. Data Preparation, 2. Model Calculations and 3. Data Presentation:

. Data Preparation: Download data from OGD sources and bring them into form needed for next step.
Ensure data quality,
. Model Calculations: Perform the calculations to generate predictions from observed data,
. Data Presentation: Show results on map and/or dashboard.
Include documentation of sources and methodology.
